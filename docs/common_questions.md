# Common Questions & Answers

- **Why does engine size have negative impact sometimes?**  
  Because while larger engines add value, they also increase emissions and reduce fuel efficiency, which may lower predicted price in eco-sensitive markets.

- **Why is mileage so dominant in SHAP explanations?**  
  Mileage strongly correlates with car wear. High mileage consistently decreases value regardless of other features.

- **What does the Grad-CAM highlight mean?**  
  The heatmap shows visual features the model considered important. For example, bright regions on headlights may indicate focus on model year styling cues.

- **Where is the vector DB used?**  
  The system uses a vector database to store embeddings of dataset metadata and explanation snippets. This enables fast retrieval of relevant context for conversation and narration.
